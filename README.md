## Creating Vehicle Images with Generative Adversarial Networks

## Abstract
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a very
interesting topic in the field of machine learning, they
provide the possibility for artificially generating
images, video, text, and audio. The development of a
GAN focused on generating new images of vehicles
could serve as a new point of inspiration for
automotive designers and engineers to explore new
vehicle designs in a much more efficient way. The
goal of this project is to develop a machine learning
model capable of efficiently producing new original
vehicle designs.

This project's ultimate goal of achieving that machine
learning model capable of producing vehicle images
was successful by developing a GAN that was able to
read in real images of existing vehicles and output
new designs. The final iterations of the GAN
developed in this project resulted in outputs that were
much more clearer and distinguishable compared to
the initial stages of the project.

## Problem Formulation
The goal of this project is to develop a GAN that
takes in real images of vehicles as input and generates
images that look similar or identical to the real images
as output.

## System/Algorithm Design
The GAN used in this project to create images of
vehicles has three key components, the generator
model, discriminator model, and training loop. The
image pipeline serves as the dataset from which the
discriminator compares real images of vehicles
against the images that the generator generates. The
training loop trains the generator and discriminative
models alternate training every epoch, in order to
ensure that both models ‘learn’ together gradually.
